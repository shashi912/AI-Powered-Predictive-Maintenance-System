# AI-Powered-Predictive-Maintenance-System
AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance System is an industry-oriented AI project designed to predict machine failures before they occur in manufacturing and industrial settings. The system leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze real-time sensor data from machines, such as temperature, vibration, pressure, and RPM.
